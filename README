I've added an example doctrine and multidomain configuration file to the project.
So that everyon can have a look how the multidomain configuration works and how it is used in doctrine.

To use the template Path you have to add this into your controller (mostly in the base controller)
$this->template = strtolower(trim(implode('/', array($this->request->directory(), $this->request->domainTemplatepath(), $this->request->controller(), $this->request->action())), '/'));

The new part is this one "$this->request->domainTemplatepath()"
